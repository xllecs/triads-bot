# About this project ðŸ¥·

A custom Discord bot built using Node.js for our FiveM server to help our mafia keep track of taxes.

Used technologies such as:
- AWSâ€™ DynamoDB to store our taxes.
- AWS' EC2 and tmux to keep the bot running 24/7.
- discord.jsÂ which is a neat way to create your own Discord bot.
- dotenv.
